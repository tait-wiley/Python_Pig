# Python_Pig
Game of pig between a player and a simple AI.  Role a die, adding each roll to your turn score.  After each role the player can choose to hold (and have the turn score added to their total score) or role again.  If the player rolls a 1, their turn score is set to 0 and their turn is ended.  The first player with a total score of 100 or more wins.
